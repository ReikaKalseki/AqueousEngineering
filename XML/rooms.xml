			Rooms in your seabase can be specialized towards one of several purposes, granting you or their contents improved functionality. To specialize a room, it consist only of things tailored towards that specialization - with a small amount of leeway given to some always-useful buildables, like lockers.
			
			Some room types also have a decoration level threshold, in particular leisure rooms.
			
			Only full-size general-purpose rooms can be specialized, not corridors, nor specialized rooms like scanner rooms or moonpools.
			
			Unspecialized rooms, which are the default, carry no bonuses.
			
			Potential specializations, along with their requirements and bonuses, are as follows:
			
			Storage (Storage-only devices, several in number)
			- Grants bonus storage capacity to lockers
			
			Power (Power and energy handling equipment only)
			- +25% power output from generators
			
			Mechanical (Processing/Acquisition machinery only)
			- -20% machine energy consumption
			- +50% charger speed
			
			Agricultural (Farming equipment only)
			- +33% yield from plant harvests
			- +25% food and water value to food crops harvested
			
			Working (Workshop-type equipment and decorations)
			- Reduced food and water consumption rate (amount depends on decoration rating)
			- -33% fabricator time
			
			Leisure (No machinery, relaxation items, {0} or {1} deco rating (small/large rooms))
			- Greatly reduced food and water consumption rate (amount depends on decoration rating)
			- Sleeping in beds grants health regeneration
			- Large morale bonuses
			
			ACU (ACUs and support infrastructure)
			- ACU internal capacity +50%
			- ACU ecosystem is slightly more tolerant and productive
